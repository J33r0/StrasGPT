## StrasGPT: LLMs Are Easier Than You Think

This program is a direct C implementation of the Qwen3 / LLaMa 3.x / Mistral LLM transformer architecture, reusing the tokenizer and the sampler of Andrej Karpathy's [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) project and its fork by James Delancey [llama3.c](https://github.com/jameswdelancey/llama3.c) (we warmly thank you!). Given an input prompt, StrasGPT can generate a text that continues it. It was initially designed as a parallel programming project for master students in 2025 (students had to parallelize it with OpenMP + MPI). It is now getting continued for fun and (polyhedral) compiler research.

## Get and compile StrasGPT

You just need git, a C compiler and make.

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.unistra.fr:bastoul/strasgpt.git
cd strasgpt
make
```

There are several other building targets:
- `make parallel` to build the faster parallel version, that target requires mpicc compiler
- `make android` to cross-compile a single-threaded Android binary, that target requires Clang compiler
- `make android-parallel` to cross-compile a parallel Android binary with OpenMP (MPI disabled)
- `make asan` for Clang's address sanitizer support and debug mode, that target requires Clang compiler
- `make debug` for debug mode, ideal when using Valgrind

## Get the model files

You can use, e.g., Qwen3, LLaMa 3.x or Mistral checkpoints from HuggingFace. You will need to create an [HuggingFace Account](https://huggingface.co/), and get an access token (click on your profile icon, then "Access Tokens"). Finally you'll need to login then to download the desired models, e.g. here are some tested models:

```bash
pip install 'huggingface_hub[cli]'
huggingface-cli login
git clone https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B
git clone https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B
git clone https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
git clone https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407
git clone https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410
git clone https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Base-2501
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct
```

## Run StrasGPT

Run StrasGPT with `-h` option to get all possible options. Here is an example of a command line with a 8-token long prompt and asking to generate 16 tokens (beyond the one generated from prompt analysis) and using 10 threads:

```bash
./strasgpt -m ../model_zoo/Llama-3.2-1B/ -p "Once upon a time there were three" -n 17 -t 10
```

And here is the output on my M4 Mac:

```

[Once upon a time there were three] little pigs.
Three little pigs went out for a pig walk. They heard music playing

Actually not that bad!
